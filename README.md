## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation? 
My motivation for this project was to understand JQuery and Moments.js

- Why did you build this project? 
I builded this project becuase I wanted to know how the API interacts with the HTML file. It's intresting what does API can do a web page. It created a complicated concept. 

- What problem does it solve?
The program solves multiple problems. The first problem that it solves is that it displays the current day of the year. The following problem that it solves it creates a similar mock of the project by using bootstrap. Depending on the time, the columbs change color. The final problem that it solves, it saves a event in local storage.   

- What did you learn?
I learned concepts of JQuery. In addition to Moments.js which it's a really intresting libary of time. The most facinating thing was bootstap, it would defiantly help me save time in the future.
